## How to use my personal website

Hey everyone! Wow, it‚Äôs been a whole year since I last wrote a blog post here. Time flies! I thought it‚Äôd be fun to switch things up today and share a tutorial instead. I've had quite a few people ask if they can use my personal site as a template for their own, and since it‚Äôs [open source](https://github.com/alsonick/notnick.io), I‚Äôm always happy to say yes! Over the last few months, I‚Äôve been busy making my site more dynamic and flexible, so you‚Äôll find it super easy to make your own changes. Let‚Äôs get started!

> Note: For this tutorial, you'll need to be familiar with the following technologies:

- [Programming](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-programming)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the GitHub project onto your computer

Firstly, to complete this step, you're gonna need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, if you don't have a GitHub account then please click [here](https://github.com/join). Once you've done that, please head over to the GitHub repository for my personal site, you can find it by clicking [here](https://github.com/alsonick) to get to it.

#### 1.1 Fork the project

To fork the project, you need to click on the button with the label "Fork" or click the arrow facing down icon and click "Create a new fork".

After you've forked the project, you should be redirected to forked project that is currently now on your GitHub page. This is the version you'll be cloning onto your computer.

#### 1.2 Copy the project git URL

You should see a green button with the label "Code", click that and make sure you're on the Local tab. Copy the HTTPS project git URL by clicking the copy icon beside the URL (should be labeled).

#### 1.3 Clone the project

Once you've copied the git URL, open your terminal of choice. For this tutorial, I'll use the default macOS terminal.

Type `git clone`, and then paste the git URL you copied earlier into your terminal. The URL should look something like this:

```sh
https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/notnick.io
```

> Note: You should clone the project in a desired location, so before you clone to project make you sure you `cd` into the directory you want to save it in. If you don't know how the `cd` command works then please [click here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=directories-changing-another-directory-cd-command).

It should take a few seconds to clone the project (sorry, for a personal website it's quite large in size lol). Once you're done, your terminal should look something like this:

You don't need to understand what this output means, but if your terminal looks something like this then you're on right track! üëç

#### 1.4 CD into the directory

After the project has been cloned, `cd` into the `notnick.io` directory.

```sh
$ cd notnick.io
```

### Step 2: Configure the project

Now we're ready configuring the project, but first we need to do a few things.

#### 2.1 Open the project in an IDE or code editor

For this tutorial, I'd **strongly** advice on you using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but if you already have an IDE or code editor you're already familiar with then just use that. Launch your code editor and open the `notnick.io` project. Your editor should look something like this:
