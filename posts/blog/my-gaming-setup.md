## My Gaming Setup

So recently I've decided to upgrade my gaming setup, because why not. The setup I had before wasn't really flexible for my needs, I had a tiny desk that was short in length, the monitors were right next to my face, also the desk was one of those L shaped desks which occupied a lot of space in my small room.

Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been on a small shopping spree, buying new parts for my setup. I got a bigger desk, a dual monitor mount, a new mousepad, a new keyboard, and an HP ProDesk 405 mini computer for homelabbing.

### Space üåå

So for the setup I wanted as much desk space as possible, so I decided to buy a cheap but decent monitor mount for my monitors for around $30, [click here if anyone is interested](https://amzn.eu/d/gcwRoUM).

### PC üñ•Ô∏è

So this is my PC, I bought it prebuilt a few years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been learning how to assemble a gaming PC, so in the future, I plan to get another one, but instead of buying it prebuilt, I‚Äôll buy all the parts and build it myself.

Specs:

- CPU: Intel Core i9-11900KF
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060
- Storage: 1TB SSD
- RAM: 32GB

I use my PC for pretty much everything: gaming, programming, browsing, watching anime, and all the other usual things people do on a computer.

### Homelabbing üíΩ

Recently, I‚Äôve gotten really into homelabbing, which is basically the practice of setting up and running your own small-scale computing environment at home for learning, testing, experimentation, or hosting your own services like media streaming.

For my home server I decided to
