## My thoughts from my time in Kenya

So its been awhile since I've came back from Kenya and I wanted to share my thoughts on Kenya and how it compares to first world countries.

### How was your time in Kenya?

My time in Kenya was great, I arrived in Kenya in february which means it was summer there. It was a nice break from the freezing winter I was experiencing in the UK.
