## Reflecting on 2025

It's that time of the year... 2025 has been a very interesting year for me. I'd like to share with you what I've been up to and what my goals are for next year!

Last year, two of my goals were to improve my piano playing skills and fully learn the [Maple Leaf Rag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Leaf_Rag) piece, composed by [Scott Joplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin). Here's an audio recording of me playing the Maple Leaf Rag:

> Yes, I know I'm only playing the C section once!

It's not perfect yet, I still need to improve playing the piece at a steady tempo, I also need to improve the trio section (C section), the trio section is by far the hardest part of the song due to the wide-ranging jumps you have to perform with your left hand. If you have no idea what I'm talking about then look at the notations:

Crazy right...

Currently, I'm learning another **Joplin** piece called the '[The Entertainer](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entertainer_(rag)>)'. So far I've learnt the A & B sections, for next year I want to fully learn this piece.

One of the goals I set for myself last year was to publish more blogs, safe to say, I've completely failed to this and that's something I want to change for next year. The reason why I'm mentioning this is because I think it's important to recognize goals we didn't achieve, we aren't perfect, and that's okay if you weren't able to achieve everything you wanted, recognizing these failures could help you finally achieve these goals in the future and grow as a person through this journey called life.

Ok, that's enough of me yapping lol, here are some of my goals for next year:

- Read more books
- Learn deeply about how AI works
- Write more blogs and notes
- Learn the 'The Entertainer' piece
- Contribute more to open source
- Learn discrete mathematics
- Get better at Leetcode
- Work on more projects

For anyone reading this, I hope you have a **Merry Christmas** and a **Happy New Year**! _Psst..._ I have a **Discord** server, if you'd like the chat with me then [definitely click here to join](https://notnick.io/community).
