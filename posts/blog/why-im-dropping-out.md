## Why I'm dropping out

I made the decision to give university a try last year, despite feeling somewhat disinterested from the outset. Deep down, I always suspected that it wasn't the right fit for me, but I enrolled anyway, both to verify my intuition and to be able to tell people that I had given it a fair chance.

### Starting university

I enrolled at the University of Kent in September of last year (2022), not particularly caring where I went to university as long as it was close to home. For the first few months, everything was going well. I was working hard, attending all my classes, and doing well in my assignments. However, during the Christmas break, I began to question whether I truly wanted to pursue this path. By the time January rolled around and classes resumed, I realized that our schedule had become much more demanding, requiring us to devote significantly more time to class work and assignments than in the previous term.

### Life in university

Although life at uni was tolerable, if I'm being truthful, I spent the majority of my time either in my room or in the library, honing my coding skills and taking on some freelance work to earn extra cash. This wasn't the norm for most university students, who preferred to spend their time partying and enjoying themselves. I don't fault them for that; let's face it, spending most of your time coding isn't exactly thrilling.

The reason why I devote all of my time to work is because achieving my life goals is so important to me. Every day, I give it my all in pursuit of those goals. While some people might view me as a loner, I choose to ignore their opinions. After all, no one can truly understand the unique aspirations and desires of another person. I realize that when you do things that deviate from the social norm, people tend to judge you, but I don't let that discourage me from staying focused on my objectives.

### Education continues

The most common misconception about dropping out of university is that it means the end of one's learning journey. However, the reality is quite different. Many people drop out of university because they realize that it isn't the right path for their personal and professional development. While this may not be the case for certain fields that require a degree, the important thing is that people are able to pursue the path that best facilitates their learning. For some, a self-taught approach may be more effective than learning in a university setting.

As one of my lecturers pointed out, companies aren't interested in degrees as much as they are interested in a candidate's skills and abilities. Obtaining a degree with minimal effort does not necessarily demonstrate one's capabilities. In many fields, it is possible to land top positions at major companies, including FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google), without a degree. There are numerous stories of individuals who have achieved career success in these companies and others without a formal education.
