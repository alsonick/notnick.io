## Reflecting on 2024

This year has definitely been interesting in terms of what's happening in the world, but for me, it hasn't been too eventful. For next year, I want to change that and, overall, be less idle with my life.

The previous year (2023) was completely different for me. I was coding almost every day and was a lot more active when it came to exercising. This year, however, was mostly a break from coding because I had done so much the previous year that I completely burned out.

For next year, I plan to change that. Here are some goals I have in mind:

- Become proficient in Java
- Read more books
- Contribute more to open source
- Write more blogs here
- Becomes more active
- Work on personal projects
- Build a bigger online presence
- Fully learn the [Maple Leaf Rag](https://musescore.com/user/116681/scores/145724)
  - Only have the trio section left to learn
- Improve my piano playing
- Learn cybersecurity

I’ll also be documenting all my goals throughout the year to hold myself accountable. Hopefully, I’ll be able to complete them all, lol. But yeah, that's pretty much it for this blog. It's two days before Christmas, so I hope anyone reading this has a **Merry Christmas** and a **Happy New Year**!
