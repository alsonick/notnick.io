## Plans For Lyrics Tags Generator 2026

For the last past year, I've been working on [Lyrics Tags Generator](https://tags.notnick.io); A service used to generate metadata for lyric videos on YouTube. I use it to generate metadata for [Polaris Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/@polaristracks), the YouTube collective group [earlyentry.io](https://earlyentry.io/) also use it to generate metadata for some of their channels on YouTube. But there are a few flaws with the service.

### The Flaws

#### 1. Static Metadata

All generated metadata, especially tags, is completely static. This means that generated tags follow a fixed format. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does limit flexibility. For example, if a song is trending for a specific reason, the service cannot generate contextual tags.

If a song is trending on TikTok because of a meme, you would want to include tags related to that meme. While you could manually add these contextual tags yourself, I want to make this process more seamless.

#### 2. No Mobile App

Currently, the site is not available on mobile-sized screens. This is because making the web version responsive on mobile is quite challenging due to the site’s design. While it is not impossible, it would require a significant amount of work and could diminish the user experience.

I plan to develop a mobile app version that will feature a slight redesign while maintaining the same core functionality. I will be building this in public, and the GitHub repository for the mobile app can be [found here](https://github.com/Lyrics-Tags-Generator/mobile).

### Integrating Artifical Intelligence

I plan to introduce an optional feature called **Contextual Awareness**. This feature will allow users to specify whether they want contextual tags to be appended automatically.

However, this feature may not work well for newly released songs, as there may not be enough data available to determine why they are trending. It is best suited for songs that are not too new and have already started gaining traction online.

### Conclusion

I am not entirely sure how effective the contextual awareness feature will be, as it will heavily rely on artificial intelligence. Building the mobile app will be exciting, as I have never published a mobile app before. I will continue to share updates on it here.
