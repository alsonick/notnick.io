## Life as an introvert

Ever since I was little I was _extremely_ quiet, and I mean really quiet, I was even diagnosed with [selective mutism](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/) which is an anxiety disorder where someone is unable to speak in certain social situations. In primary school I only had one friend that I felt comfortable speaking to alongside some teachers.

By definition introversion and shyness/quietness doesn't really correlate but for some people they can be linked. In my case, introversion causes me to be more shy. But by definition an introvert is someone who typically prefers to spend time alone or in small groups.
