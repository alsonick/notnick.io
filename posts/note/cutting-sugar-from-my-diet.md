## Cutting sugar from my diet

So recently, I've decided to stop eating foods and snacks that contained high amounts of refined sugars, as of writing this note it has been 1 week without eating sweats, chocolates, crisps or anything that's considered unhealthy.

### Cravings

It’s only been a week, but I can already notice some changes. For the first five days of not eating any treats, my cravings were insane. Every time I walked into a shop, my brain was still wired to grab something sweet and tasty. That had been the norm for me. Whenever I went into a shop, I would always pick up unhealthy snacks. Fighting the urge to grab a chocolate bar was not easy.

The urge to grab unhealthy snacks is not as bad now. I can walk through the sweets and chocolate sections just fine. Before, I would tell myself that having one Snickers bar wouldn’t affect me.

### Natural Sugars

Since cutting out foods and snacks that contain refined sugars, I’ve been eating a lot more fruit, which contains natural sugars that are actually good for you. Fruit is nutrient-dense and provides the body with fiber, vitamins, and minerals that are so crucial for your health.

### Noticeable Changes

So far, it’s only been a week, but I’ve already noticed some changes. One big change has been my weight. After cutting out calorie-dense snacks that didn’t fill me up in the slightest, I’ve lost some weight. Before, I wouldn’t even realize I was eating over my calorie intake because I could eat a bunch of snacks and still not feel full. Then I’d go and eat a proper meal. Because I didn’t feel full, I had the illusion that I hadn’t eaten many calories beforehand.

### Conclusion

I’m going to continue cutting refined sugars out of my diet, and I’ll probably post an update on how it’s going in a few months. I’ve also started exercising, and I plan to make a post about that soon, so stay tuned. As always, thanks for reading!
