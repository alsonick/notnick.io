## Just a little update

It's been a while since I last wrote a note on here, so I decided to write one now in bed, lol. I'm studying [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), so I haven't had much time to write here, but I'm trying to change that by improving my sleep schedule (I'm getting there lol) and managing my time better.

### How's uni life?

Well, uni life is fine and I'm enjoying my course, I spend most of my time studying, reading, playing piano, watching Netflix series or just playing video games. I'm a huge introvert so I find joy in solitary activities.

### Conclusion

The year is coming to an end so I'll probably write a blog reflecting on 2024 so be sure to keep your eyes out for that, but apart from that, I don't have much else to say. Enjoy your day, and stay healthy! ðŸ˜Š
