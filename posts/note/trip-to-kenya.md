## Life Update

I'm writing this note to give an update on myself, on February 9th I'll be going to [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya) for 5 weeks to visit family members. During this time I won't be too active online so I won't be able to respond to messages or emails too quickly.

I'll be posting all the photos I take [here]() so be sure to take a look. I'll also be posting the photos on my [community server](https://notnick.io/community) so be sure to join!

Enjoy your day! ðŸ˜Š
