## Networking Notes

I’ve made these notes for educational purposes but anyone who’s interested in networking or anyone who needs to look back on certain topics can use these notes.

New notes will be added regularly and if you’d like me to cover a certain topic in networking then [please DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/heynickn). Notes will start from easy → intermediate → advance topics.

If you spot any grammer or spelling mistakes then feel free to [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/alsonick/notnick.io).

### What is a Network?

A network is two connected computers sharing resources.

#### Types of networks:

- Physical Connection (wires, cables)
- Logical Connection (data transporting across the physical media)

### Networking Rules

- The computers in a network must use same procedures for sending and receiving data.
- Data must be delivered uncorrupted.
- Computers in a network must be capable of determining the **origin** an **destination** of a piece of information.
  - #### Examples:
    - Internet Protocol (IP)
    - Mac Address

### Types of Networks

- Personal Area Network (PAN)
- Local Area Network (LAN)
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
- Campus Area Network (CAN)
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- Wide Area Network (WAN)

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

Small networks used for personal use to share data from one device to another.

#### Examples:

- Smart Phone → Laptop
- Smart Watch → Smart Phone
- Heart Rate Monitor → Smart Phone

### Local Area Network (LAN)

A computer network within a small geographical area, such as a single room, building, or groups of buildings.

#### Examples:

- Home Network
- Small Office Network

### Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

- A network that’s fully dependent on wireless connectivity.
- Most home networks are WLAN.

### Campus Area Network (CAN)

A network of multiple interconnected LANs in a limited geographical area.

#### Examples:

- University Campus
- Corporate Business Park

### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- A network that interconnects users with computer resources in a city.

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

A network that extends over a large geographical distance.

### Examples:

- The Internet
- Google Offices

### Network Architectures

#### Examples:

- **Peer-to-Peer (Decentralized)**
  - All computers on the network are peers.
    - No dedicated servers
  - All computers can act as either a client or a server.
  - Common in homes and businesses.
  - Easy to set-up.
- **Client-Server (Centralized)**
  - A network composed of client and servers.
    - Servers provide resources
    - Clients receive resources
  - The servers provide a centralized control over network resources.
  - Accounts, security, and access control to administration tools are typically centralized.
  - Requires an IT administrator.

### The OSI Model

The Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model

- A conceptual framework showing us how data moves throughout a network.
- Gives us a clear understanding of how networks operate.
- It’s not implemented in the **real world**.
