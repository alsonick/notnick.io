## Why you should join buildergroop

Online there are many communities for ambitious people, [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) is one example, It's a community where you can find people with similar interests. Today I wanted to focus on [buildergroop](https://www.buildergroop.com/) in this blog.

Obviously, this blog is subjective and [buildergroop]() might not be for you, but that's fine! I just want to share my experiences, how I benefitted from the community, and how I think it will benefit you. Alright, let's get started!

### Why did I join buildergroop?

Well, I first joined because my friend [@aaryamvn]() created yet another discord server and me being the good friend I am ðŸ¥¹ joined the server. At first, I wasn't really active because I thought this community was just another server so I didn't really see the point in spending time in there. Later on, they hosted their first buildertalk, which is basically a talk with a notable member of the entrepreneurship community, their first talk was with [@heybereket](), someone I highly respected, and the second buildertalk was with [@alistaiir](), someone I also highly respected.

After these talks, I realized this was a community that the founders wanted to take seriously, and I also gained a lot of value from these talks, so after that, I tuned in to almost all the other buildertalks and became an active member, you can [join]() their discord server and you might occasionally see me in the chat sometimes, I'm not too active right now since I'm working on my own things but I recommend you join and meet the folks in there.
