## Why I'm dropping out

Last year I decided that I'd try out university and see If it was a fit for me, before I even joined university I wasn't too excited about it because deep down I always knew uni just wasn't for me, but I joined anyway to to really verify it for myself and to tell people that I gave it a show at least.

### Starting university

I joined university on september of last year (2022), I didn't really care which uni I went to but I chose the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/) because It was close to home. So fast forward to December and everything was going alright so far, I was doing well in my assignments, attending all my classes and overall just working hard.

In December I also went back home for the christmas break and around that time is when I started to question If I really wanted to take this path of going to university. So fast forward to January and university opens again classes start, our schedule was a lot heavier compared to last term meaning that we'd have to spend a lot more time with class work and assignments.

### Going downhill

I started the year with adapting good habits into my life, like waking up early, getting 8 hours of sleep, hitting the gym and eating healthy. When I joined university again I was able to be consistent with my good habits for about 3 weeks. After I stopped my good habits it dawned on me that university wasn't for me and I hated it so much, I hated how I was learning, going into a lecture to just sit there listening to lecturer read off the slides just isn't for me.
