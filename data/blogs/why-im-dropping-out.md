## Why I'm dropping out

Last year I decided that I'd try out university and see If it was a fit for me, before I even joined university I wasn't too excited about it because deep down I always knew uni just wasn't for me, but I joined anyway to to really verify it for myself and to tell people that I gave it a show at least.

### Starting university

I joined university on september of last year (2022), I didn't really care which uni I went to but I chose the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/) because It was close to home. So fast forward to December and everything was going alright so far, I was doing well in my assignments
