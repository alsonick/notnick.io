## Reflecting on 2022

First of I want to start off by saying happy new year! Last year has been pretty eventful for me and a lot of other people, a lot has happened! I'm writing this short belong post to reflect on my achievements.

I want to mainly talk about my experience as a developer, from the start of 2022 I was past the beginner stage but I didn't really have any projects under my belt, when I was first learning to code I made the mistake of continuously watching tutorial videos on YouTube and Udemy, this is known as [tutorial hell](https://medium.com/codex/what-is-tutorial-hell-and-how-to-avoid-it-to-improve-as-a-developer-8c5376c97011). At the start of 2022, I made a goal to contribute to open source and build some projects that you can view on my [GitHub](https://github.com/alsonick) page.

I'm now more confident in my skills as a developer and I've also fallen in love with open source, this year I'm starting a project that will be dedicated to providing open-source tools for developers, check it out [here](https://github.com/okaridev).
